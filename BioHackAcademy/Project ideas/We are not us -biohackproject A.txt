Plan A: We are not us

90% of our cells are not human, but because the other living organisms are so small compared to our cells, you don’t notice. Starting from this notion I wanted to create a human head using mycelium as a basis by letting it grow in a mold of a human head. And using the colourful bacteria’s we got acquainted  with during the course to colour the hair, eyes etc.
First thing I have done is testing which colour-producing bacteria’s are agreeable with mycelium. You can see the photo for the result.
Then on 21th October 2015 we sterilised the mold with bleach and then alcohol. After that we filled it “painted” it with a blend of malt agar. Then we filled the mold with straw that has been sterilised in the pressure cooker for 20 minutes. The straw will provide for structure (so that the resulting head is strong enough to show on our final night) and food for the mycelium.
We then added the bits of mycelium which I cultivated before. The big question will be if the mycelium will grow fast enough to fill up the mold before the 17th when our presentations are planned.
But all we can do now is wait…
